Problem statement – the student enrolment dataset has information about state wise total students, pre-primary, primary, upper primary, elementary, secondary, higher secondary students’ enrollment. Write codes for principal component analysis.



Tools used – pandas, sklearn, principle component analysis



Outcome – the outcome of this principle component analysis is helped to reduce dimensionality. By calculating first covariance then eigen values, eigen vectors by quadratic equation to reduce dimensionality.
